        <h1>ISBN Map --- Global books in one visualization</h1>
        <p>
            This project offers an interactive visualization of the entire ISBN universe. Several different views are available, starting from a global map and zooming into more details down to each individual book. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and click and drag to move around the map. Currently, it is optimized for desktop use. Rare books (with fewer than 2 copies) are indicated with a fire icon ðŸ”¥, while red dot/book ðŸ“• icons represent books not in Anna's Archive and green dot/book ðŸ“— icons represent books collected by Anna's Archive. Please note that there may be data anomalies.
