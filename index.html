        <h1>ISBN Map --- Global books in one visualization</h1>
        <p>
            The ISBN Map project offers an intuitive window into the global world of books by transforming the linear ISBN spaces—from the 978- to 979- prefixes (with the 13th digit as checksum)—into a two-dimensional map. The goal is to convey the vastness of book data in a clear, accessible way, while avoiding user overwhelm.
          </p>

        <div class="canvas-container">
            <canvas id="baseCanvas" width="1000" height="800"></canvas>
            <canvas id="overlayCanvas" width="1000" height="800"></canvas>
        </div>
        <div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; padding: 20px; background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
            
            <h3>Data Sources and Focus</h3>
            <p>
              The visualization aggregates data from multiple sources such as Google Books, OCLC/Worldcat, CADAL, CERLALC, DuXiu, EBSCOhost, Goodreads, Internet Archive, ISBN Global Register, Libby, Nexus/STC, OpenLibrary, Russian State Library, and Imperial Library of Trantor. However, the current focus is on <strong>Anna's Archive</strong> (prefix: <code>md5</code>, approximately 16 million books).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Technical Approach and Implementation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mapping the ISBN Space:</strong> Converting the linear ISBN space into a two-dimensional format while incorporating the checksum digit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flask Integration:</strong> Embedded within an existing Flask framework via a simple route, the application runs on the client side using pre-generated static data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactive Design:</strong> Inspired by Google Maps, the interface includes features like zooming and panning to explore the ISBN space without overwhelming the user.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Challenges and Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
              A key challenge is the inherent imperfection of the ISBN system, where publisher reuse of ISBNs means multiple books may share the same identifier. While these inconsistencies are not addressed in the current version, they represent important areas for future work—potentially involving advanced data science techniques and AI.
            </p>
            <p>
              Publishers occasionally reuse ISBNs, especially for older books, or they may issue a new ISBN for the same content (e.g., reprints). This can lead to multiple books sharing the same ISBN, which is not addressed in the current version of the visualization. Future enhancements could involve advanced data science techniques to address these anomalies and provide a more accurate/complete representation of the ISBN space.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, while we have indicated some rare books in the current version (as shown in the image below), we only cover a partial set of books related to one identifier. Even the first ISBN(978-000000000-2) in the whole space has started to face this issue. We will continue to improve the data quality and visualization in the future.

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Effective Visualization:</strong> Successfully maps the vast, linear ISBN space into an accessible two-dimensional interactive format.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> A minimalistic design that emphasizes clarity and ease of navigation without over-engineering.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Foundation for Future Enhancements:</strong> Sets the stage for addressing data anomalies and integrating advanced analytical methods, and AI.
